                - sleeps for (timeToProcess * 1000) milliseconds
                - emulates the ticket processing without the actual processing


    public long modifyTimeToProcess(Passenger passenger);
        - checks if passenger is a slow process
        - if slow, increases time needed to complete an actionSequence for passenger


    public void checkPassenger(Passenger passenger);
        - Go through passenger's conditions and modify actions based on them
        - Only checks booleans that require different functions, not modify current ones

    private float RateOfProcess;
        - rate at which agent can process customer.
        - should be greater than Agent's RateOfProcess

    public void moveSupervisor(Line line); - move supervisor to indicated line
    public void sideLine(); - remove supervisor from check-in, not permanent


public Line():
    - GOAL: handles queue of passengers looking to process their tickets


    private Queue line;
        - data structure that handles query of passengers
        - with Queue's pop() method, we don't have to implement remove method since it does that automatically
    private boolean inUse; - indicates whether line is processing a passenger


    public void addPassenger(Passenger passenger);
        - adds passenger to the end of queue of this object


    public void processPassenger();
        - begins processing pop() passenger for flight
        - exact implementation varies by subclass line


    public acceptSupervisor(Supervisor supervisor);
        -

    public void removeSupervisor();
        -


    public PersonLine() - subclass of Line, handles booth operated solely by people
        - GOAL: handle queue for people entering ticket processing booth done by human

        private PriorityQueue line;
            - Queue to enter booth
            - Gives higher priority to passengers with frequent flier status

            - starts off with an agent at booth
        private void processPassenger();
            - processes passenger with frequent flier, if none then process queue as normal



    public AutomatedLine() - subclass of Line, handles processing mainly by a terminal

        public AutomatedLine(Agent agent);

            - initially starts off with all its terminals available


        public void processPassenger();
            - allocates a terminal to the pop() passenger
            - terminal begins processing passenger's ticket

        private Terminal removeAvailableTerminal();
            - removes first terminal from queue when it is allocated to passenger

        public void addAvailableTerminal(Terminal terminal);

    public boolean useTerminal(Passenger passenger);
        - processes passenger's ticket
                * if successful passenger leaves terminal and exits booth
                * else redirected to personLine

    private void redirectPassenger(Passenger passenger);
        - redirects passenger to person line
        - since we're assuming passenger only redirected at front of terminal

        - might redirect passenger if problem persists

public Passenger():
    - GOAL: easily creatable objects that enter random queue to processed


    private boolean isFrequentFlier;
        - indicates whether passenger has frequent flier status
        - frequent flier entitles passenger to higher priority in check-in line
    private boolean slowProcess;
        - if true increases processing time
        - else process time unmodified
    private boolean requireManager;
        - if true passenger can only be processed at intervention of supervisor


    public Passenger();
        - constructor, automatically move to line on generation
        - determines on creation whether the passenger will be a slowProcess or not
        - determines whether passenger requires a manager to process them

    private void enterLine(Line line);
