    Types of lines:
        - in person
            * requires an agent and/or supervisor to operate
            * frequent flier (priority, no worry about starvation)
        - automated
            * frequent flier (no priority given, float around preset terminals)
            * require only a single agent per preset number of terminals
            * line only keeps track of users waiting to use group of terminals

    Terminal Properties:
        - assume terminals are never wears down or bricks
        - process passenger's ticket
        - if passenger unable to operate terminal or passenger redirected pass passenger to person queue

    Agent Properties:

        can oversee in person line or automation line

        supervisors
            * float between lines
            * passengers processed faster than regular

            * can work both person and automated booth
            * default: start with 1 (can pay for more)
            * able to shift supervisor or sideline him as reserve

        regular

    Passenger Properties:
        - generated randomly over time
        - autonomously queue at check-in line
        - Occasionally redirected from automated line to person line
            * design does not indicate when so assuming redirected after hitting terminal
        - Enter as either single or part of group
        - Passenger competence:
            * use automation without assistance (not all)
        - once past our booth not our problem anymore
        - we assume every passenger CAN be processed
            * no fake tickets
            * not a criminal/terrorist
        - may have excess baggage
        - generally either waiting or getting processed

            * passenger with excess baggage, needing more time for weight check and fees
            * passenger repeatedly re-routed (requires supervisor), blocking queue
            * plane overbooked
